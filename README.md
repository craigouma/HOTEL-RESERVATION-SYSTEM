# HOTEL-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
This code defines a Hotel class with a make_reservation method that allows guests to make reservations for specific room types during a given time period. It also includes a Reservation class to represent a reservation, and a Guest class to represent a guest. The code also includes error handling for invalid room types, check-in/check-out dates, and unavailable rooms.

This is just a sample implementation and can be modified and extended to include additional features and functionality as needed.
