# HOTEL-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
This code defines a HotelChain class that represents a collection of hotels, and a search method that allows users to search for available rooms across all hotels in the chain. It also includes a Hotel class with a cancel_reservation method that allows users to cancel reservations, and a get_available_rooms method that returns a list of available rooms for a given time period and room type. The code also includes a Payment class to represent payments, and a Guest class to represent guests. The Reservation class has been updated to include a status property and a total_cost property, and the make_reservation method has been updated to accept payment information. 
This code creates three guests and three payment dictionaries, and uses the make_reservation method of the Hotel class to make reservations for these guests at different hotels and room types. The make_reservation method accepts the guest, check-in and check-out dates, room type, and payment information as arguments, and returns a Reservation object.
